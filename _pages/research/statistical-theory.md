We have applied novel methods to comparing body-size distributions and the effects of fishing based on fish body-size and behaviour, and work closely with Rebecca Fisher of the Australian Institute of Marine Science developing [R functions](https://github.com/beckyfisher/FSSgam "R functions") for conducting robust regression analyses. We have a strong statistical emphasis in student supervision focusing on the importance of reproducible research and clear communication of results.
