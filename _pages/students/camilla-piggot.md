## Fish recruitment in coastal habitats of north-west Australia
<img class="philprofile" src='/images/Milly_WS.jpg' align='right' width="350" hspace="20" vspace="10">
Fish recruitment and post-settlement survival are key ecological processes that help sustain viable, fishable, populations. Despite their importance, we have little understanding of these processes in north-west Australia. Focusing on ecological and indigenously important fish species, and working with indigenous rangers, my project aims to explore, temporal variation in recruitment processes; spatial variation in habitat use by juveniles; and quantify the relative significance of different habitats to juvenile fish throughout north-west Australia. These data will help inform indigenous management strategies in the region and will provide an insight into a fundamental fishery process in a unique and challenging environment. 

## About me
Growing up in the UK I developed a keen love for the ocean from an early age and furthered this interest by graduating from the University of Plymouth in 2007 with a degree in Marine Biology and Coastal Ecology. After six years working in marine environmental education and research I completed an MRes in Marine Ecology and Environmental Management at the University of Glasgow. In 2014 I moved to Australia to start my PhD. During the last four years I have worked closely with indigenous communities in the Kimberley and worked as a PhD intern at the Kimberley Marine Research Station setting up long-term research projects on tropical rock oysters and intertidal corals.
