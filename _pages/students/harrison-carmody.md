## Understanding the factors influencing shark depredation in Western Australiaâ€™s Mackerel Managed Fishery
<img class="philprofile" src='/images/' align='right' width="350" hspace="20" vspace="10">
Shark depredation, where a fishing catch is partially or completely consumed by a shark before it can be retrieved by the fisher, occurs in commercial and recreational fisheries globally. Anecdotal reports suggest that depredation attributed to sharks may be increasing in frequency in the Mackerel Managed Fishery (MMF) in Western Australia, however there is currently minimal evidence to verify whether this is the case. The fishery also lacks evidence for which species are responsible for depredation, information essential for any future development of deterrents. Additionally, changes in the spatial and temporal patterns of depredation in this fishery as well as the impact of other environmental and human factors such as sea temperature and vessel experience are currently not completely understood. To better understand the factors influencing depredation in the MMF and how they vary spatially and temporally, this study will analyse 11 years of fishery dependent commercial logbook data collected from 2006 to the present.  The study will be carried out in collaboration with the Fisheries division of the Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development. Understanding the level of influence different factors have on shark depredation within the MMF will provide both the fishery managers and fishers themselves more information as to the characteristics of this behaviour as well as help inform future management decisions. 

## About me
I'm Perth born and bred and have been in and around the ocean my whole life. Growing up most most of our family holidays revolved around marine activities such as snorkelling, fishing or boating which, along with living close to the coast in Perth have helped me develop a strong passion for the marine environment. I graduated from UWA in 2016 with a Bachelor of Biological Science, majoring in Marine Science and Conservation Biology. After traveling for a year, I returned to UWA to complete my Masters.
