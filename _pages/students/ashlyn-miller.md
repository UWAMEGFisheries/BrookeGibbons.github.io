## Improving estimates of natural mortality and growth rate of juvenile western rock lobsters *(Panulirus cygnus)* in Dongara, Western Australia.

An important component of stock assessment and management of a fishery is the ability to provide accurate information for population modelling. Estimates of natural mortality and growth rates are two parameters that are essential for the statistical modelling of a target population. The present study aims to improve the accuracy of estimating natural mortality and growth rates for juvenile western rock lobsters, Panulirus cygnus, in the biogeographic centre of the fishery off Western Australia. My research will involve intensive mark-recapture tagging of juvenile individuals over a six month period within specific sites off Port Denison, Dongara. The study will be carried out in collaboration with the Fisheries division of the Department of Industries and Regional Development. Improving estimates of these population parameters will allow the study to distinguish the relationship between growth rate and natural mortality, whilst also providing essential information required for adequate stock assessment and harvest strategies of the fishery.

## About Me
I grew up in Perth and like most Western Australians the ocean has been a central part of my life. I developed a passion for the marine environment from a young age through numerous family holidays spent snorkelling, fishing and surfing. I graduated from UWA in 2016 with a Bachelor of Biological Science, majoring in Marine Science and Zoology. After a year off spent travelling, I have returned to complete my Masters.
